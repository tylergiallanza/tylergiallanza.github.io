        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Designing Weighted Associative Classifiers</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">Tyler Giallanza<br>September 4, 2018</p>
        <p>My latest research project with Dr. Hahsler could less politely be called "stealing the concepts that work for neural networks and hoping that they work when we apply them to association rules." For those unfamiliar with association rules, classification, and neural networks, let me give some background. For those of you who already are familiar, feel free to skip the next few sections. If you're really pressed for time, skip to the summary at the bottom.<p>
        <h3>Association Rules</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning">Association Rules</a> are a simple way of finding patterns in data. The draw of association rules is that they distill a large amount of information into a coherent and easy to understand rule.</p>
        <p>For example, let's pretend that we're a grocery store interested in finding out what items are commonly purchased together. If we know that customers who buy item A are more likely to buy item B, we can use this information to stock item A and item B next to each other on the same shelf. This was actually one of the first use-cases of association rules. Allegedly, a grocery store gathered information on 1.2 million shopping carts and used association rules to find that customers who buy diapers also tend to buy beer! This somewhat odd association rule is written as \(\{diapers \Rightarrow beer\}\). We would say the the <i>Left hand side (LHS)</i> of this rule is \(diapers\), and the <i>Right hand side (RHS)</i> is \(beer\).</p>
        <img src="beer_and_diapers.jpg" class="img_fluid mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:80%;" alt="Beer and diapers">
        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>Although the probably apocryphal story about the beer and diapers is entertaining, it's not really what I do with association rules. My goal is to use these rules for a task machine learning people call <i>classification</i>. The classification problem is as follows: if we have a bunch of information about an item (such as the groceries in a grocery cart), can we put that item in a certain category (for example, what is the income of the person pushing the cart)? </p>
        <p>There are essentially two parts to a classification task: the <i>input variables</i> and the <i> class variables</i>. In this case the input variables are the information about the shopping cart. We might have one variable that details how many items are in the cart, and another variable that tells the price of each item in the cart. The class variables are what we try to find using this information. In this case, maybe we have "high income," "middle income," and "low income" as our income levels.</p>
        <h3>Associative Classification</h3>
        <p>Since association rules find patterns in data, and classification is concerned with patterns that lead to class variables, association rules can naturally be used for classification. Essentially, the idea is you find rules that have a class variable in the RHS, and you can use these rules to classify different things. For example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>\(\{truffle\text{ } oil,salmon\}\Rightarrow\{high\text{ } income\}\)</li>
          <li>\(\{hamburger\text{ } helper,ramen\}\Rightarrow\{low\text{ } income\}\)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These two rules would be able to classify someone who buys both truffle oil and salmon as high income, and someone who buys both hamburger helper and ramen as low income. There are a variety of algorithms that employ association rules for classification, including <a href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/KDD/Software/CBA/cba.html">CBA</a>, <a href="http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/sdm03_cpar.pdf">CPAR</a>, and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/presentation/2e1d/ab46b0547f4a08adf8d4dfffc9e8cd6b0054.pdf">CMAR</a>. My goal is to outperform these algorithms by making more accurate classifications.</p>
        <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>As the first sentence of this post suggests, my proposed method involves stealing techniques from neural networks. To dramatically oversimplify, neural networks essentially take in a bunch of input data, assign each input a different weight, and do a weighted vote to see which class gets predicted. The "secret sauce" that makes neural networks work so well is that they look at more and more training examples, updating the weights over and over again. This weight adjustment algorithm is called the <i>optimizer</i> because it tries to optimize the weights that the network finds.</p>
        <img src='nn.png' class='img_fluid mx-auto d-block' style='max-width:80%;' alt='Simple Neural Network'>
        <p>Again with dramatic oversimplification, the neural network in the image above works as follows. First, gather your inputs \(x_0 ... x_M\). Then, multiply each \(x_i\) by a certain \(w_i\), the weight of that input variable. Finally, sum all of these weighted inputs, \(\sum_{i=0}^M w_i x_i = w\cdot x\). That sum can, oversimplifying, be treated as the probability that the training example we're looking at belongs to class \(y\). Thus, if that sum is a low number, say \(0.2\), we can be reasonably confident that the given example is not of class \(y\).</p>
        <h3>Putting it All Together</h3>
        <p>With the theoretical foundations in order we can look at how I combine association rules, classification, and neural networks in my research. Essentially, Dr. Hahsler and I believe that, by using this weighted sum approach popularized by neural networks, we can use association rules to make classifications on our data. Doing weighted voting of association rules for classification isn't new. However, we believe that we have a better approach than existing algorithms.</p>
        <p>In brief, the issue that current classifiers have (most of them anyway) is that they don't look at or use enough rules. In our approach we initially look at a very large number of possible rules, generally tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of rules. Using the neural network approach, we can figure out which rules are the good rules, and by what margin they are good. We have two advantages over existing algorithms. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Our classifier can make more accurate predictions than the existing classifiers, presumably because we consider more rules, and we use a well-tested process for weight assignment that is highly optimal.</li>
          <li>Our classifier can make faster classifications than the existing classifiers. Our system takes a long time to train and determine the rule weights, but once those weights are decided our method is fast at using those rules.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why it Matters</h3>
        <p>If neural networks are so good, why don't we just use neural networks? Also, why do we care about making faster and more accurate classifiers when the existing algorithms are pretty good as well? To answer the first question, an issue people have with neural networks is their relative opacity; it's hard to tell what's going on inside of a neural network. Association rules are very transparent - it is easy to see why the algorithm makes the choices that it makes, and it's easy to manually adjust some of the rules if the algorithm is making a mistake.</p>
        <p>To answer the second question, it helps to think about some of the use cases of this new classifier. It takes a very long time to figure out which rules are good rules, but once it does we can very quickly and very accurately make predictions using those rules. There are lots of domains that don't really care about how long training time takes and are only concerned with classification time. For example, in finance you may have months to develop an algorithm that has to perform in real-time, where microsecond delays can lose you thousands of dollars. As another example, in cybersecurity you can spend a long time developing a system that seperates between real user behavior and nefarious user behavior, but the system needs to run as fast as possible so that threats can be detected quickly.</p>
        <h3>In Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I developed a new type of classifier based on association rules.</li>
          <li>This classifier uses techniques from neural networks to assign weights to different rules.</li>
          <li>The classifier is faster and more accurate than other association rule classifiers.</li>
          <li>I'm working on putting this into a package in the R programming language so that others can use this tool.</li>
          <li>I'm working on writing up the results in a paper and presenting it at an academic conference so other that researchers hear about this tool.</li>
